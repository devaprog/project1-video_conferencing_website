      <p>
          For any organization to function efficiently, personnel must be able schedule meetings without
      wasting vast amounts of time determining a time and location to fit everyone's schedule. This is a
      project plan describing the Web-based Meeting Software (WMS), a program that will assist in
      automating the process of determining the best times for various participants to meet.
      The project involves creating a Software which will allow users to initiate meetings and acquire
      information about potential meeting attendees' time preferences to find an optimal meeting time.
      WMS users will update their schedules with times they are unavailable as well as times they
      prefer to meet to help guide users who are initiating meeting to find the best available meeting
      time.</p>

      <p>
          The purpose of the WMS is to automate the process of scheduling a meeting while considering
      time constraints of all the participants. The system will enable users to initiate and schedule
      meetings while viewing times that potential meeting attendees are available and busy. Through
      this automated process, meetings will be scheduled with a great deal more efficiency than the
      prior method of selecting and scheduling meeting times which required multiple communications
      between meeting initiator and participants before a time could be selected.</p>
