    For any organization to function efficiently, personnel must be able schedule meetings without
wasting vast amounts of time determining a time and location to fit everyone's schedule. This is a
project plan describing the Web-based Meeting Software (WMS), a program that will assist in
automating the process of determining the best times for various participants to meet.
The project involves creating a Software which will allow users to initiate meetings and acquire
information about potential meeting attendees' time preferences to find an optimal meeting time.
WMS users will update their schedules with times they are unavailable as well as times they
prefer to meet to help guide users who are initiating meeting to find the best available meeting
time.</p>

    The purpose of the WMS is to automate the process of scheduling a meeting while considering
time constraints of all the participants. The system will enable users to initiate and schedule
meetings while viewing times that potential meeting attendees are available and busy. Through
this automated process, meetings will be scheduled with a great deal more efficiency than the
prior method of selecting and scheduling meeting times which required multiple communications
between meeting initiator and participants before a time could be selected.
